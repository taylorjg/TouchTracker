I have taken a simple program from chapter 19 of the "iOS Programming" book from The Big Nerd Ranch and added
networking support. The program deomonstrates the following:

- Use of GKPeerPickerController to connect 2 devices together
- A custom protocol which consists of several different types of packet
- Sending and receiving packets as dictionaries of fields
- Choosing one device as the host which then controls the order of play
- The devices taking it in turns to play (in this case, to draw lines)
